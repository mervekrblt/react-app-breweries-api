# react-app-breweries-api

This is my first app which I have built using react.js.

I got lots of help from this tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaioUnMw0mo&t=1817s)


Technologies that I used 

- React.js
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- [Bubblle Effect](https://www.csscodelab.com/css-water-effect-bubbling-example/)
- [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation)
- [Icons](https://icon-icons.com/)
- [Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

```
git clone https://github.com/mervekrblt/react-app-breweries-api.git
```
    
Install all dependencies and run the app
```
npm install
